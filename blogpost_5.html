            >“Netflix sounded a little porny, but it was the best we could
            do.”</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Those were the exact words Netflix’s Co-founder, Marc Randolph, used
          to answer the question of how they came up with the name Netflix. In a
          recent podcast interview with Mindvalley’s Vishen Lakhiani, Marc
          shared with us the story behind how Netflix went from concept to
          company. He traveled way back in time to when he and his eventual
          co-founder Reed Hastings would carpool in the Bay area and, every day,
          Marc would pitch Reed a new business idea. Some ideas were not so
          great — customized baseball bats and customized shampoo. Other ideas
          transformed into something much greater — Netflix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marc Randolph was 38 years old when he started Netflix, but he had
          successfully launched over five ventures beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are 5 pieces of advice from the co-founder of Netflix, a company
          founded in 1998, that is now generating over 20.16 billion USD in
          annual revenue.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Start now and start small; never leave an idea in your head.</h2>
        <p>
          There’s nothing more damaging to aspiring entrepreneurs than mere
          inaction. I can attest to this myself as I spent the entirety of my
          mid-twenties talking about starting a business, but I never did. In
          2011, at a university competition, I delivered a two-minute elevator
          pitch about a food-delivery app, won second place, but I did nothing
          about it. All throughout my time working at Google, all I did with my
          close friends was entertain start-up ideas, but we never put them in
          action. That’s why, as soon as I resigned, my single top priority was
          to finally start a project on my own. And within one year of doing so,
          I witnessed the greatest professional and personal growth in my life.
          Here’s the single most important advice Marc Randolph has for you:
          Stop talking about your ideas or entertaining them in your head. Stop
          talking and start doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >“You have to figure out how to quickly, easily, and cheaply get
            your idea out of your head and collide it with reality.”</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Every idea you have in your head sounds like the next big thing. And
          the more you think about it, the bigger it becomes. But here’s a
          reality check: It isn’t. Your idea is incredibly flawed because it has
          yet to be subject to outside forces. It has yet to solve a person’s
          problem. So how do you start? In his chat with Vishen, Marc gives an
          example of a university student who once approached him with the idea
          to build a peer-to-peer clothing-rental business. His solution was
          quite simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          He asked her for a pen and a piece of paper and prepared a sign that
          read: “Need to borrow clothes? Knock.” He then told her to slap it on
          her dorm-room door and see what happens. Just by doing so, and within
          a few hours, she’ll be able to find out whether or not the idea is
          viable. If someone knocks, it is.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            How to apply this: Marc’s advice comes down to three simple steps:
          </strong>
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Getyour flawed idea out of your head and put it on paper. Your idea
            doesn't need to be viable, as Marc explains, “it just needs to be
            something that stimulates what the problem is you’re really trying
            to solve.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Get over that fear that keeps you from starting. Here’s one small
            mental shift to help you do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            Get busy testing your idea so you can figure out the flaws in it.
            Once your idea is in public, as people engage with it, you begin to
            identify the flaws in it, which then allows you to reflect,
            reformulate, and rebuild. So don’t get lost in the branding just
            yet, prioritize shipping your product so you can further explore the
            validity of the problem it solves.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          2. The magic lies not in the idea, it lies in the testing process.
        </h2>
        <p>
          This second lesson is the reason why Marc’s number one piece of advice
          for aspiring entrepreneurs is to just start; because once you do,
          you’ll come to realize that the magic does not lie in your idea, it
          lies in your testing process.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            “It’s not about having good ideas. It’s about the system, the
            process, and culture for testing lots of bad ones.”
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Implementation is everything. That’s exactly why James Clear has
          become so famous for saying that “you do not rise to the level of your
          goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” Likewise, in
          entrepreneurship, you do not rise to the level of your ideas, you fall
          to the level of your systems. This is another lesson I learned in my
          first year of entrepreneurship: You’re only as good as your systems
          and processes. And that’s exactly why in my second venture of building
          a writing business, the first thing I did was build myself a writing
          system that would allow me to rise to the level of my goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>How to apply this:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In a fast-moving world, you need to move faster. Find a cheap, quick,
          and clever way to build systems that would allow you to continually
          test and retest your ideas. As Marc explains: “The trick is not having
          the idea. The trick is how quickly and how cheaply and how easily and
          how cleverly you can figure out a way to take an idea and test it.”
        </p>

        <h2>3. Culture is not what you say, it’s what you do.</h2>
        <p>
          This lesson is short and simple, but it’s implications are profound.
          When asked about Netflix’s culture, Marc replied with this:

            >“Culture is not what you say. Culture is what you do.”</strong

          It’s not about your aspirations or inspirations, it’s about how you
          behave. How you carry yourself. How you treat yourself, your
          co-founder, your employees, and your customers. Stop talking about
          your principles, start modeling them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, Marc’s words echo what Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of my
          favorite thinkers, wrote decades ago: “What you do speaks so loudly
          that I cannot hear what you say.”
        </p>
        <p><strong>How to apply this:</strong></p>
        <p>
          It’s really simple. Say what you’re going to do and be accountable for
          it.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Think long-term by focusing on what not do to today.</h2>
        <p>
          Marc shares the story of how long before Netflix became an online
          streaming service, they not only rented DVDs, they also sold them.
          And, at one point in time, 90% of their revenues came from selling
          DVDs. It was there when the founders found themselves at a junction
          point. They knew that it was just a matter of time before other
          companies would start selling DVDs, which would transform their
          business into a commodity-based model and thus reduce their margins.
        </p>
        <p>
          They also realized that their recent focus on DVD sales was
          distracting them from fully focusing on their core model of attaining
          rental rights. The question was: “Where do you go from here?” Do you
          focus on what’s paying your salary and driving 90% of your revenue? Or
          do you focus on the ultimate long-term goal of the business — the
          rental service (even if it’s showing no signs that it’s working)?
          Well, I guess you know what happened next. They said they were all in.
        </p>
        <p>
          So they walked away entirely from selling DVDs, slashed 90% of their
          business, and focused solely on growing their rental model. And the
          rest, as they say, is history.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Find balance, or you will crash.</h2>
        <p>
          As the conversation came to an end, Vishen asked Marc this question:
          “What’s your biggest passion right now?” His answer will shock you:
          “From the very beginning, my big focus has been on balance. Since I
          was in my twenties, I’ve learned — and it dawned on me — that I was
          not a whole person if I was working all the time.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He explains how every Tuesday he steps out the door at 5.00 pm sharp
          to have dinner with his wife. And how he regularly goes mountain
          biking and cross-country skiing. He does what makes him whole and
          happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            “So, what am I interested in?” continues Marc, “It’s mastering
            balance.” Every end of the week, end of the month, and end of the
            year, he looks back to reflect on his progress and answer the
            question of “how did I do?”</strong

          Manage your energy first because what good can you do if you’re
          totally exhausted? Trust me, when I say this, burnout will break you.
          It took me less than six months of constant hustle, non-stop work,
          sleepless nights, zero social life, and an exuberant amount of
          overthinking for me to hit the wall crashing. That was when I decided
          that I was done; I removed the word hustle from my dictionary and
          replaced it with ‘slow living and mindful consistency.’ I slowed down,
          put my health first, and created more balance in my life.

            >In the lessons above, Marc Randolph bestows on us his brilliant
            wisdom:</strong
          >
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Never leave an idea in your head — start now and start small.</li>
          <li>Build systems that facilitate a continuous testing process.</li>
          <li>Remember that culture is what you do, not what you say.</li>
          <li>
            Focus on one thing (your core competency), get good at it, and
            always play the long-game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prioritize balance in your life so you can stay whole and happy.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          All the above are great lessons, but the one below rises above all. As
          Marc was explaining the importance of finding balance, he said the
          following: “You can’t have business success be the metric of success
          in your life.”
