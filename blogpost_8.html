      <div class="blog-post-text">
        <p>
          Recently we hosted a Q&A at Asana that I participated in with Ben
          Horowitz, Matt Cohler, and Justin Rosenstein. Marcus Wohlsen from
          Wired attended and wrote an article that discussed our views on the
          culture of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. This is an important
          topic, so I want to take some time to clarify what we meant in this
          blog post. Before I do, I’d like to emphasize that we were talking
          exclusively about Silicon Valley culture and not the more general
          ‘small business entrepreneur.’ So for our audience at the time,
          entrepreneur meant “Silicon Valley startup technology entrepreneur.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Even given that context, it is notable that we all said you “probably”
          shouldn’t be an entrepreneur, not that you definitely shouldn’t. This
          is explicitly a directional position; we believe there are too many
          startups and entrepreneurs in the SV ecosystem, but that is very
          different from saying there shouldn’t be any. Many people think there
          should be more, and we are counterbalancing that view. Whenever you
          counterbalance an extreme view, you tend to also come off extremely,
          and certainly do in the media (which is related to the point I made
          about integration in my last post).
        </p>

        <p>
          The reason we like best for becoming an entrepreneur is that you are
          extremely passionate about an idea and believe that starting a new
          company is the best way to bring it into the world. The passion is
          important because entrepreneurship is hard and you’ll need it to
          endure the struggle, as well as to convince other people to help you.
          Believing that starting a new company is the best way to bring it into
          the world is important to ensure that resources—including most
          importantly your own time — are being put to the best possible use. If
          the idea is best brought into the world by an existing team, then it
          is tautologically optimal for the world for it to happen that way. Of
          course, not everyone is actually trying to optimize their impact, but
          many entrepreneurs are, by their own admission, and it is important
          for those people to consider this angle.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re not trying to maximize impact, then it seems like a
          reasonable assumption that you are instead optimizing around personal
          lifestyle preferences of some kind. You want total freedom to choose
          how you make your living, regardless of if it necessarily provide
          large amounts of value to other people or perhaps is even redundant
          with something that already exists. Or you want extreme flexibility in
          your schedule, maybe including the ability to stop working altogether
          for long periods of time at short notice. Or you want to work on a
          certain kind of problem or with certain kinds of people. For many
          kinds of preference, you likely can actually find a company able to
          give them to you, but certainly starting your own is a great shortcut
          and I personally think that’s totally reasonable. I like people who
          are seeking to have big impact on the world, but it is not the only
          path worth taking, and I have no reason to denigrate this type of
          entrepreneur.
        </p>

      

        <p>
          <strong>
            So with all that in mind, here are some of the bad reasons to become
            an entrepreneur that we were actually trying to speak to:
          </strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You want to be your own boss in a big company. Evernote CEO Phil
            Libin put it well last year:
            <p class="wp-block-quote">
              “People have this vision of being the CEO of a company they
              started and being on top of the pyramid. Some people are motivated
              by that, but that’s not at all what it’s like. What it’s really
              like: everyone else is your boss – all of your employees,
              customers, partners, users, media are your boss. I’ve never had
              more bosses and needed to account for more people today. The life
              of most CEOs is reporting to everyone else, at least that’s what
              it feels like to me and most CEOs I know. If you want to exercise
              power and authority over people, join the military or go into
              politics. Don’t be an entrepreneur.”
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            You think it’s glamorous. The media does a great job idolizing
            various entrepreneurs, crowning Kings and designating Godfathers of
            various mafias, but this is all colorful narrative. The reality is
            years of hard work, throughout which you usually have no idea if
            you’re even moving in the right direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            You believe you’re extremely talented and that this is the way to
            maximize your financial return on that talent. Why wouldn’t you want
            more of the cap table? This is flawed logic, since the 100th
            engineer at Facebook made far more money than 99% of Silicon Valley
            entrepreneurs. Small slices of gigantic pies are still themselves
            gigantic. If you’re extremely talented, you can easily identify a
            company with high growth potential and relatively low risk and get
            an aggressive compensation package from them. If you turn out to be
            wrong after a few years, you can try again. Within 2 or 3 tries, and
            likely on the first one, you’ll have a great outcome and can be
            confident you contributed serious lasting value to the world. If you
            instead try to immediately start “the next Google or Facebook”,
            there is a very high likelihood that you will fail completely, or be
            forced to settle for a much smaller outcome. It will take a long
            time to reach success or failure, so you won’t have many tries.
            Comparison of financial outcomes between joining an established
            company that performed really well and starting your own. Notably,
            the table on the right assumes you succeeded. Examples of achieving
            massive impact after joining an established company. You heard Paul
            Graham compared non-founders to animals at a zoo and don’t want to
            look like a chump (or a chimp). As Jeff Atwood points out, this is
            much more projection than fact. There are companies that feel like
            they were lifted out of a Dilbert cartoon and treat their employees
            terribly and then there are, you know, good companies. Work for one
            of those, or work for yourself, but definitely don’t work anywhere
            that you can describe as “soul-sucking”. Yes, this viewpoint is
            somewhat self-serving. We want to hire the best at Asana, and many
            of the best are choosing to become entrepreneurs instead of applying
            at companies like ours. That said, we only need to hire a quite
            small number of those folks to ourselves succeed. The bigger concern
            is the macro effect of spreading talent too thinly across the board
            and the micro effect of people not spending their time in valuable
            ways. Zuck himself has speculated that Silicon Valley is not
            obviously the place he would start a company like Facebook today for
            exactly this reason. As to the micro effect, I like the way Justin
            puts it: “If you’re going to devote the best years of your life to
            your work, have enough love for yourself and the world around you to
            work on something that matters to you deeply”.
