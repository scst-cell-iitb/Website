            <span class="upper-letter s">S</span>arah has worked at
            <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Guardian Technologies</em> for
            nearly a decade now. She started out her career at the company as an
            entry-level sales associate and has since worked her way up to a
            sales executive.
          </p>
          <p>
            She makes well over $100,000 a year, loves her team, her company and
            her life as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            When her more entrepreneurial friends poke fun at her for being a
            “nine-to-fiver” or “not dreaming big enough” she doesn’t mind. In
            fact, she finds it amusing.
          </p>
          <p>
            She deeply respects her friend’s drive to build the next Apple or
            Facebook… but she couldn’t be happier with her job and her life.
          </p>
          <p>
            She gets nights and weekends off as she watches her friends spend
            most of their “free time” working.
          </p>
          <p>
            During her late twenties, she has been able to cross countless
            destinations off her travel bucket list with a hefty 4-weeks worth
            of vacation each year, while her friends have been locked up in
            their apartments building and rebuilding and then rebuilding some
            more after that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not to mention… when she hits her bonuses… she makes more than them
            combined. <em>But, who is counting?</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            I want to begin by saying the dream to become an entrepreneur isn’t
            a silly one… not in the least.

          <p>
            However, I would be remiss if I didn’t say the dream to become an
            “employee” isn’t a silly one either. In fact, there is a great deal
            of me that would argue it’s a better one for some people.

              “<em>employee-ship</em>”</strong

            seemed to have gotten a bad rap, all of a sudden being a
            “9–5&#8217;er” became uncool… that aspiring to work for a company

            unmotivated or a follower. I totally disagree.

            The story about Sarah above (her name and the companies name have
            been changed for privacy purposes) highlights some of the benefits
            employees get to enjoy that most entrepreneurs don’t… until they
            “make it” (or <strong><em>if</em></strong> they ever make it).
          </p>
          <p>
            While I’m not naive to think that Sarah’s experience is every
            employee’s experience, hitting a home run and selling your company
            for a billion dollars isn’t every entrepreneur’s experience either —

          <p>
            “I’ll be happy when”… is a thought that has ironically caused much
            unhappiness for men and women chasing anything in this world.
          </p>
          <p>
            We find ourselves running after something — marriage, kids, a bigger
            house, a nicer car — and when we finally catch the thing we’re
            chasing, we find ourselves still feeling a bit empty.
          </p>
          <p>
            In psychology, this concept is called “<a
              href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/the-focusing-illusion/"

              rel="nofollow noopener"
              >focusing illusion</a
            >”, it’s a cognitive bias where people place too much emphasis on a
            future event and as a result inaccurately predict the reality of the
            event.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think about a time you’ve told yourself a story about a goal or
            dream you were going after and in your head it looked like a fairy
            tale… but once you actually achieved the goal or dream the reality
            was far less epic.
          </p>
          <p><em>That’s focusing illusion.</em></p>
          <p>
            In “<a

              >Why setting big goals can make you miserable</a
            >”, I explained it using the concept of “post-marathon syndrome”, a
            well-documented state of sadness, worthlessness and letdown. It’s a
            natural human reaction.

            Many aspiring entrepreneurs suffer from such a psychological
            phenomenon. They tell themselves stories of what life as an
            entrepreneur will be like… but once they actually live the life of
            an entrepreneur they discover the reality is anything but.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often times, these stories come in the form of “I’ll be happy when…”
          </p>
          <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
            <p><em>I’ll be happy when</em>… I start a business.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
            <p>
              <em>I will be happy when</em>… I am making $100,000 a year from my
              business.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
            <p>
              <em>I will be happy when</em>… I sell my business and become a
              milllionaire.
            </p>

          <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

          <p>
            One story aspiring entrepreneurs tell themselves is that they will
            be happy when they find some of the many myths associated with
            entrepreneurship — <em>flexibility, wealth, notoriety, etc.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            But, from my own experience as an entrepreneur, these illusions
            aren’t discovered or achieved through entrepreneurship:

              — while Jotform has been a modest success for myself and my team,
              for every modest entrepreneurial success,
              <a
                href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/everything-learned-about-failure/"

                >there are thousands of failures</a
              >. And, regardless of the Cinderella stories you hear in the
              media, the reality of entrepreneurial failure is anything but a
              fairy tale. There’s nothing poetic about going tens of thousands
              of dollars in debt because your dream didn’t take off. Where it
              concerns entrepreneurship, I would argue that wealth isn’t
              something that should be expected…
              <em>I’d argue it’s a rare exception. </em>In fact,
              <a
                href="https://www.sokanu.com/careers/entrepreneur/salary/"

                >according to this study</a
              >, the average entrepreneur makes roughly $5/ hour starting out
              and established entrepreneurs make $62/ hour. Yes, that’s good
              money, but far from being a millionaire.
            </li>

              <strong
                >I will be happy when I have more <em>Notoriety</em> as an
                entrepreneur</strong
              >
              — another misconception of entrepreneurship is that it leads to
              notoriety or fame. While yes, some entrepreneurs like Musk and
              Zuckerberg are celebrated like rock stars, most of us go
              completely unnoticed. Instead of trying to make it to a magazine
              cover,
              <a
                href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/dominating-tech-news/"

                >I choose picking olives and spending quality time with my
                family</a
              >.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So, when you truly look at flexibility, wealth and notoriety… you
            realize that entrepreneurship isn’t necessarily the best path to
            take to achieve these things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entrepreneurship isn’t for everyone. Just because it’s cool or you
            are born to become an entrepreneur doesn’t mean your friends should
            become one.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want more flexibility, you might as well work for a
            remote-friendly company. If you seek wealth, you might as well make
            money working in real estate, sales or investment banking.
          </p>
          <p>
            While there’s nothing wrong with these things, they can’t
            necessarily be found through entrepreneurship… or at least it’s not
            the easiest path to find them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before making the choice to become an entrepreneur (or an employee
            for that matter), we can ask ourselves what will truly make us happy
            and be extremely realistic with ourselves… because it might just be
            <em>focusing illusion</em> getting the better of us.
