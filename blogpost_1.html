        <strong> 1. What is ‘merit’ and ‘meritocracy’?</strong>
        <p>
          ‘Merit’ is the virtue of being able to out-perform others or fulfil a
          set criterion of performance among a group of individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          A ‘meritocracy’ is an ideal world where preference and rewards are
          directly proportional to the performance, hence better performers gain
          higher rewards. But a pre-condition to such world is that there is no
          discrimination and bias against anyone, that all are provided a level
          playing field where everyone is at the same starting point in terms of
          socio-economic, political and cultural privilege.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a wonderful idea. But if a society thinks that it is a
          meritocracy with its pre-conditions present, when in reality it isn't,
          this idea becomes something very dark and twisted. It is because it
          contains a fundamental belief that the successful deserve their
          success and those who fail, deserve their failure.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. Background of meritocracy in India -</strong></p>

        <p>
          On August 16 1932, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was able to secure the Communal
          Award which provided separate electorates for Dalits. This ensured
          that only Dalits were eligible to vote in the seats allocated to them.
          This would have ensured that there was no interference of non-Dalits
          in the governance and administration of Dalits. In this way, they
          could carve their progress outside the Hindu caste system which
          suppressed them for centuries. This was perceived by MK Gandhi as a
          threat to Hindu Unity. Also, it would have left the Congress as
          representing at best only the non-Dalit Hindus, comprising roughly 50%
          of the country’s population. M.K. Gandhi went on a fast unto death if
          Dalits continued their demands to split. This was a huge gesture, and
          it effectively forced Ambedkar to concede. The compromise that emerged
          was called the Poona Pact, wherein instead of separate electorates,
          the Scheduled Castes were going to get "reservations." So essentially,
          in order that Dalits can be merged into the larger Hindu voter base,
          they had to compromise on their self-secured emancipation given as
          Communal Award. And worse thing is that from the moment reservations
          were implemented, upper castes have constantly complained that it has
          been destroying merit and they are making it as an excuse to harass
          Dalits and Adivasis in public institutions. Whereas, in the first
          place India was never a meritocracy nor has attained that state yet.
          So firstly, Dalits & Adivasis were made to compromise on their rights
          and now they are humiliated for the limited provisions they have been
          offered. Hence, reservations which are called out as
          concessions/charity/compromise made by upper caste are in fact the
          compromise imposed upon Dalits by the upper caste in exchange of a
          highly empowering system of Communal Award.

            >3. Meritocracy demands a level playing field. So, is India a
            fertile land for meritocracy as of now?</strong

        </p>
        <p>No, it is not. Some facts can help us answer this.</p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <strong> Crime Data: </strong><br />
            According to NCRB data, there were 33,719 cases of crimes against
            Dalits in 2011, and this figure rose to 50,291 in 2020. A more
            horrific picture appears when one looks at the crimes against Dalit
            women. Almost 10 Dalit women or girls are raped each day. A total of
            8,272 cases were registered for committing crime against Scheduled
            Tribes (STs), showing an increase of 9.3 per cent over 2019 (7,570
            cases)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Representation Data: </strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong> Judiciary </strong>- According to National Commission
                for Schedules Castes, in 2011 out of 850 High Court judges, only
                24 come from Dalit and Adivasi communities
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Education </strong>- In 2018, representation of SC, ST,
                OBC faculty in total at IITs was merely 9% and at IIMs it was
                even grim at a mere 6%
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Civil Services </strong> - In 2019, government in
                Parliament reported that only one of the 89 secretaries posted
                at the Centre belonged to the Scheduled Castes (SC), while three
                belong to the Scheduled Tribes and none belonged to OBC. Out of
                93 additional secretaries in central government ministries, just
                six are SCs and five are STs, while there are no OBCs of this
                rank either.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Economic status </strong> - According to a 2014
                government report, over 44.8 percent of Scheduled Tribe (ST) and
                33.8 percent of Scheduled Caste (SC) groups in rural India
                continue to live below the poverty line.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Earlier this year in February, a Dalit IPS officer who wanted to
                ride horse had to take heavy police protection for his
                pre-wedding ceremony in Jaipur.
              </li>
              <li>
                In 2020, Priya who is a Dalit and a panchayat president in
                Mayiladuthurai of Nagapattinam district alleged that the
                panchayat vice-president had been threatening her and not
                allowing her to use the chair allotted to her at the office.

                harassment from her upper caste colleagues.

            >4. So, why is it that merit outcry is made by upper caste when
            essentially there is no ground for meritocracy in the unequal
            societal structure of India?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The ground for merit outcry for upper castes comes from
          non-recognition of their own privileges. Our constitution only
          recognizes caste as a source of disadvantages for lower caste. Upper
          castes have spent centuries accumulating enormous caste capital. This
          capital looks different for different communities. For Brahmins, it's
          a history of access to literacy learning and as a result
          administrative power. For Vaishyas and Kshatriyas, it could mean
          control over land and wealth and trading networks. These pre-existing
          advantages mean that when the British established a westernized
          education system, upper castes were the first to benefit. When this
          education system became the basis of entry for all the new professions
          like law and the Indian civil service, again they were the first to
          benefit. And that advantage keeps getting passed down from generation
          to generation. In this way, over time, caste capital is converted into
          modern "currency" - into qualifications, into professional
          achievements. And because the Constitution does not officially
          recognize any of these caste advantages, upper castes could capture
          all of independent India's opportunities while insisting they had done
          it through fair and open competition. At the same time in government
          jobs and in education, upper castes labeled themselves as "General" -
          while lower caste had to identify their specific caste.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a situation that is fundamentally weird. It actively hides the
          truth. This became clear in 1990 when the government announced that
          it's going to implement the recommendations of the Mandal Commission
          and new quotas were created in public sector jobs and in education for
          OBCs who were historically deemed as "Shudras" and occupied the lowest
          rung in the caste order and therefore faced oppression and
          exploitation as well. Half of all the seats were now reserved.
          Immediately there were huge protests across India, led mostly by upper
          castes, who complained that this would destroy merit in India forever.
          The only reason that every oppressed group, i.e. SC, ST and OBC needed
          caste need reservations is because the "General" category was being
          over-represented by upper castes (see pt. 7, 1st para). According to
          the Mandal Commission, India's population was roughly 23% SC-ST and
          52% OBC. So, put together they're roughly 75% of the whole country.
          And the recommended reservation for both together was roughly 50%.
          This meant that the remaining 50% of all jobs and university seats
          continued to be dominated by upper castes, who were roughly only 25%
          of the whole country. This is the upper caste reservation which is
          seldom talked about. Now, the protests around the Mandal Commission
          suddenly appear in a very different light. They're not about upper
          caste fighting for the principles of fairness and merit. They are
          about upper class fighting against the reduction in their quota of
          seats.

          <strong>5. Myth of castelessness and the myth of merit : </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Younger generations in upper caste families may genuinely believe that
          they are "casteless". But all that means is that their parents did the
          conversion of caste capital into money and qualifications before them.
          In their lifetime, they might not be seeing any benefits from caste
          specifically. But for this generation at least, all those benefits
          that come from family are caste, it's just one step removed. These
          generations may have to remind themselves that there is no Maths or
          engineering gene. There is nothing intrinsic about Brahmins that makes
          them better at intellectual pursuits. Being born a Rajput does not
          automatically make someone brave, Baniyas are not inherently good at
          business. If there is a distinguishable pattern of upper caste
          dominance in the general category of an institution like IIT, that is
          not a sign of merit. That is a sign that the caste system is still
          alive, that caste capital is still deciding the lives of people today.

            >6. Brahminical merit vs Scientific constitutional merit
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Reservations as an instrument of government policy emerged as an
          integral part of the anti-Brahmanical movements in Maharashtra and
          Tamil Nadu in the dawn of the 20th century. The attack on reservations
          under the garb of merit outcry emanate from a Brahminical idea of
          merit rather than from any scientific or constitutional concept of
          merit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brahminical idea of merit is that the merit possessed by an individual
          is essentially acquired in unverifiable previous births. So
          essentially the unequal nature of society around is justified by the
          Brahmanical notion of karma and rebirth which implies that a lower
          caste is born in a pitiable state due to his/her own bad karma. Hence,
          those who claim of merit violation by reservations essentially believe
          that their own privileges are justified as they were earned by them in
          their previous births leading their births in upper caste community.
          This is a very cunning plot which defies all scientific logic. A
          scientific and constitutional concept of merit doesn’t allow any
          illogical, superstitious or religious belief to justify inequality in
          the society. It considers the historical and current social reality of
          an individual and their group to decide the scaffolding required to
          provide a level playing field to them. It tries to remedy the sick
          society from its disease of casteism by implementing reservations.

            >7. Is representation really an issue? What is reservation? Should
            reservation be implemented on the basis of economic
            criteria?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand if representation is really an issue, we can take a few
          examples. In 2018, in IIT Madras 255 out of 256 unreserved seats for
          which technically any caste or gender is eligible, went to upper
          castes. In 2017, women made up just 8% of the total student strength
          of all IITs put together. Results of a 2009 study found that when
          applying for a job, candidates with upper caste Hindu names were twice
          as likely to be called for interviews as compared to those with Dalit
          names, even if they had the same education and experience. So,
          caste-based discrimination is indeed an issue which needs redressal.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have many problems in society such as poverty, unemployment,
          overpopulation etc. All these problems have their own mechanisms and
          accordingly separate means to address them. Lack of representation due
          to caste discrimination is a distinct problem and has its own
          historical genesis and hence its own unique remedy. Reservation is a
          scheme of affirmative action to ensure representation of historically
          marginalized communities in employment, educational institutions and
          legislature. It is not a poverty alleviation program hence the
          criteria to address caste based lower representation can never be
          economic. It is very evident from daily news that economic mobility or
          higher education or even attainment of legislative positions (see 3.c)
          doesn’t allow any lower caste to surpass caste-based humiliation or
          torture. The purpose of reservation is to increase representation for
          historically oppressed communities - to put them in positions of power
          in boardrooms, newsrooms and courtrooms that they have been
          systematically kept out of for generations. If one understands caste
          as an actual source of power, and caste-discrimination as oppression
          instead of some vague disadvantage, one can understand why people need
          reservation on the basis of caste. The idea of reservation, the hope
          of reservation, is that once enough lower caste people are in
          positions of power, the effects of caste oppression can be countered.
          Reservations were never meant to single-handedly destroy the caste
          system, but they are a vital first step.

            <p>
              Prof. Ashwini Deshpande (Delhi School of Economics) and Prof.
              Thomas Weisskopf (University of Michigan) conducted a study on
              impact of reservation on productivity and efficiency in the Indian
              Railways between 1980 and 2002 and found that it did not reduce
              productivity in any sector, but had, in fact, raised it in some
              areas. The study also remarks that individuals from marginalised
              groups may be especially highly motivated to perform well when
              they attain decision-making and managerial positions, because of
              the fact that they have reached these positions in the face of
              claims that they are not sufficiently capable, and they may
              consequently have a strong desire to prove their detractors wrong.

            <p><strong>Reservation in educational institutions –</strong></p>
            <p>
              Reservation is only implemented at the entry level to facilitate
              entry of oppressed and systematically removed groups. All the
              students undergo the same training after the entry and have to
              pass similar standards set by respective courses in order to
              secure their degrees. So, there is no question of lack of
              capability or merit in a reserved category student, who just
              receives a push in the initial stage, and is allowed to pick up on
              his/her own once admitted.

              In October and November 2017, a study was carried out by Stanford
              University, AICTE and the World Bank on 45,453 first and
              third-year students across one IIT, seven NITs and other
              engineering institutes under the AICTE. It revealed that
              disadvantaged students (SC/ST/OBC) make significantly more gains
              than advantaged students in math, physics, and quantitative
              literacy from year one to year three.
