        <p>
          A frequent question we get at YC is “when do I start thinking about
          the FDA?” Obviously, there is no single answer to such a complex
          question, but here are some basic rules of thumb for how to think
          about it:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It makes sense for every founder considering a bio product to get a
            basic FDA education from day one.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choosing the proper regulatory pathway is nuanced; research and
            experts can help.
          </li>
          <li>
            Correctly setting up your GxP process and running studies “the FDA
            way” at the right time is essential.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Navigating the FDA process effectively is absolutely key for startups.
          If you invest too much too early, you may unnecessarily burn cash too
          fast. Conversely, if you start too late, you may have to redo work,
          potentially slowing down your process substantially. An analogy we
          often share with founders is that work done before investing in the
          FDA process is like sketching with pencil, while committing to the FDA
          process is like using ink. As you can imagine, planning your sketch
          and practicing it in pencil, and only then committing to ink, will
          lead to the best results.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our experience, we often see pre-product startup founders pursuing
          two simultaneous projects:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Running a “killer” experiment that demonstrates that their product
            can work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Figuring out the appropriate FDA regulatory pathway for their
            product.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Startups run these simultaneously because they’re interdependent and
          because the learnings from the killer experiment often help determine
          the proper regulatory pathway. Imagine you’ve been iterating on a
          novel therapeutic in vitro. Your killer experiment might be showing a
          therapeutic effect by doing an in-vivo experiment in a representative
          animal model. By getting some sense of the therapeutic effect and its
          mechanism, you can compare your therapeutic to others with similar
          safety profiles or that treat similar populations or diseases. This
          comparison process can help you choose the regulatory pathway that
          makes the most sense for the product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we’ve watched many startups do a lot of work on their
          “killer experiments” before deciding on their FDA regulatory pathway.
          These are some of the approaches we’ve seen YC companies pursue:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In-vitro experiments at the bench, using banked cells or
            banked/cultured tissues.
          </li>
          <li>In-vivo experiments using animal models.</li>
          <li>
            In patient experiments
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"
              >under IRB</a
            >
            with physician oversight.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finding a non-clinical research use for your technology that does
            not require FDA approval.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pursue research, industrial, agricultural, or veterinary
            applications of technologies that will eventually be used for human
            health.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When startups have been developing diagnostics, we’ve also seen
          companies working on tests with a lab component decide to start first
          with the CLIA/CAP LDT process, and only then pursue FDA clearance.
          This can be a reasonable choice for certain classes of diagnostic
          tests as it allows you to start delivering diagnostic results at small
          scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some important questions to consider as you set out on your
          FDA journey:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >When should I start doing things the FDA way (e.g. set up GxP,
            Quality System etc)?</strong
          ><br />
          As we described in
          <a
            href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/fda-orientation-for-early-stage-startups/"
            >a previous post</a
          >, doing things the FDA way is vital to getting the regulatory green
          light you need before you can market your product. It’s time-consuming
          and complex, entailing setting up your quality system, documenting
          appropriately, and running studies according to tightly controlled
          protocols. But doing it the right way will expedite the regulatory
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no easy answer for exactly when to start doing things the FDA
          way. Ideally, though, your founders understood at a basic level when
          they started the company what the process may look like for your
          product. An early team might have already gathered some data on their
          product’s safety and efficacy from their killer experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, the cost and time associated with your experiments is often
          a factor in determining the best time to start doing things the FDA
          way. A company developing a digital health product will usually start
          the process sooner than a company developing a therapeutic, because
          the former requires less time and energy if pivoting becomes
          necessary. Nevertheless, a good rule of thumb for any company to
          follow is that when your team feels confident that its technology
          could work, it’s probably the right time to begin thinking about its
          regulatory implications. And, it may be a good time to seek feedback
          from the FDA or counsel from a consultant or lawyer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Should I hire a consultant or a lawyer?</strong><br />
          Starting the FDA process can be expensive, so doing smart planning and
          budgeting can help your startup efficiently navigate the FDA process.
          If you’re an early-stage company who’s raised only a small seed round
          or less, seeking advice from a regulatory consultant is a good way to
          get started. Consultants bring a wealth of regulatory experience, but
          may not be expert in your domain. Ideally an early stage consultant
          has experience in both your diagnostic or therapeutic area and the
          regulatory pathway you’re most seriously considering. And of course,
          they understand many of the financial and regulatory dynamics
          companies at your stage are grappling with.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be sure, consultants have different specialties; some focus on
          therapeutics while others are experts in medical devices and
          manufacturing or regulated software. There are frequent discussions
          within the YC bio community about which consultants are good in which
          areas. If you can’t identify a consultant who meets all three
          criteria, you can sometimes use one like a lawyer–as a primary outside
          counsel who is your go-to FDA resource, while hiring specialists on an
          as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, while there are exceptions, it’s unusual to hire a
          regulatory-affairs attorney during your company’s early stages. On the
          other hand, it’s important to retain an intellectual property lawyer
          early on. We’ll cover that in a future post.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Is a lawyer better than a consultant?</strong><br />
          Early stage startup founders often believe a lawyer who specializes in
          life science regulation is superior to a non-lawyer consultant.
          Generally, we don’t agree, but a regulatory lawyer can be an immense
          help when a startup finds itself expecting to challenge an FDA
          decision such as the agency refusing to sign off on a regulatory
          pathway for your product while green-lighting a competitor’s process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What can I hire a consultant to do?</strong><br />
          For many early stage bio companies, a consultant is useful for the
          following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Determining the pros and cons of different regulatory options, such
            as whether to pursue 510(k) or DeNovo? Or 505(b)(1) or (b)(2)?
          </li>
          <li>
            Whether choosing a Pre-sub or Pre-IND would be beneficial for a
            product like yours. The consultant can also do the filing and
            request the meeting with the FDA.
          </li>
          <li>
            Figuring out what your IND (Investigational New Drug) submission
            package should look like, including: Is chronic toxicity testing
            required? How long? Where will it be run? What will your
            manufacturing look like and where will you do it?
          </li>
          <li>
            What will your NDA (New Drug Application) require? Can you get an
            approval in 100 patients, or will you need a 20,000 patient safety
            database?
          </li>
          <li>
            Researching related products to understand the studies they ran, the
            claims they made, and what their timelines looked like.
          </li>
          <li>
            Determining what suppliers are often needed for your type of
            manufacturing, clinical research, and the like?
          </li>
          <li>
            Researching the statistical techniques you should use, and which
            bio-statisticians are experts in your area.
          </li>
          <li>
            Filing all your clinical and marketing approval submissions until
            your company hires a full-time regulatory staff.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deciding if your product is a candidate for special FDA programs
            like
            <a
              href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/breakthrough-therapy"
              >Breakthrough Designation</a
            >
            or
            <a
              href="https://www.fda.gov/industry/orphan-products-development-events/story-behind-orphan-drug-act"
              >The Orphan Drug Act</a
            >?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you’re going to hire a consultant, you must be able to share the
          following in order to get the best results:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A full list of the experiments you’ve run so far.</li>
          <li>
            An explanation of the diseases or conditions your technology can
            best attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            A complete roster of competing or similar products that are already
            on the market.
          </li>
          <li>
            The regulatory pathways you believe will best apply to your product.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As with any advisor, the more you arm your consultant with relevant
          and helpful data about what you want to achieve and what you’ve
          already done, the more valuable she can be for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this information in mind, you can start planning your next steps
          and building out a budget and timeline. Remember that good consultants
          can be incredibly expensive. We often see quotes in the $6,000 to
          $20,000 a month range for part-time consultants. To best manage your
          costs, you should have specific outcomes in mind before you hire a
          consultant. This will help you keep their hours under control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because there are so many consultants and consulting groups, we
          recommend soliciting leads from your network first. Sometimes, in
          fields like medical devices, you can find the names of consultants by
          examining regulatory submission summaries, which are public record.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, you can find a consultant who’s experienced with your
          specific regulatory pathway and who also understands your diagnostic
          or therapeutic area. But remember that medical device consultants,
          small molecule drug development consultants, and biologics consultants
          are typically different sets of people.
        </p>
        <p>
          By hiring a good consultant and signing a healthy consulting
          engagement, you’ll be more confident and educated about your
          regulatory options, the processes you must follow, and your criteria
          for success. That’s especially true if your consultant can help with
          aPreSub or Pre-IND process. And while your consultant may be
          responsible for executing the process, she will not and should not
          drive the process or specific outcomes. Founders often mistakenly “let
          the regulatory tail wag the business dog,” so to speak. A good
          consultant, like a good lawyer, will look to you to define your
          desired business outcomes and then provide counsel to meet those
          outcomes as best she can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, companies typically hire multiple consultants for different
          functions. But in the early going, when exploring your regulatory
          options is so important, it’s common to retain just one. Later,
          though, you may want to think about hiring biostatisticians, clinical
          study designers, and manufacturing or supply chain consultants.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.enzyme.com/">Enzyme</a> (YC S17) offers
          consulting services tailored for startups, with particular experience
          in medical device/diagnostic, combination product and digital health
          products.
        </p>
        <h2>The first regulatory hire, and staffing a regulatory team</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes, startups can make their way to commercialization using only
          consultants for their quality and regulatory needs. But eventually
          this arrangement becomes suboptimal and cost-prohibitive and the
          startup must hire in-house quality and regulatory people. The specific
          timing for this evolution depends greatly on the type of products
          being developed. For example, it’s not uncommon for a therapeutic
          startup to hire a full-time regulatory specialist as one of the first
          ten employees. But neither is it uncommon for a digital health startup
          to wait until they’ve closed their Series B funding to bring on a
          full-time regulatory hire. Ultimately, the right time to make this
          transition is dictated by the work underpinning it. But something to
          keep in mind is that the how of making something and getting it
          approved is in itself valuable knowledge–and something you want to
          infuse your company’s DNA with before you embark on your
          second-generation product.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s important to remember that regulatory and quality leads typically
          work cross-functionally, and will need to work with team members from
          product development to marketing regarding compliance. Many quality
          and regulatory professionals who work with early stage companies are
          able to “dual-hat”, i.e. perform both quality and regulatory
          functions, but many specialize and do just one or the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hiring someone with regulatory expertise is frequently difficult for
          first-time founders who haven’t been through the process before, and
          this specialization can exacerbate the hiring dynamic. Early stage
          companies have a wide variety of quality and regulatory needs,
          including maintaining the quality system, leading regulatory filings
          such as PreSub, Pre-IND, IND, etc., and working cross-functionally to
          create documentation, standard operating procedures and the like.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why it’s vital to ensure that someone is tackling your
          regulatory strategy and filings, and also ensuring that you have and
          are following a functioning QMS. Making sure you have and are
          operating under such a system is often considered “the FDA way.”
        </p>
        <h2>What Investors Will Care About</h2>
        <p>
          Given the time and expense associated with an FDA approval or
          clearance, investors want to understand your company’s regulatory
          story before considering an investment. Regarding your clearance, some
          of the things they’ll want to examine include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What’s your risk profile? Which regulatory clearance are you
            pursuing and how likely are you to get it?
          </li>
          <li>
            What’s the timeline? Where will the company be when it is five years
            old?
          </li>
          <li>
            What’s the budget? How much money will it take to get the approval?
            How much more will you have to raise at the next round?
          </li>
          <li>
            How well do you understand your pathway and the many hurdles you
            will need to navigate to get approval?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When raising money, you should be able to present clear materials that
          address these questions with relevant clinical data. We will cover how
          investors evaluate bio startups in another post.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Many of the decisions you have to make in relation to the FDA and your
          company’s regulatory needs will be neither simple nor easy to make. We
          hope this post can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Help founders determine their early stage hiring or consulting needs
            when it comes to the FDA.
          </li>
          <li>
            Help founders understand when the right time is to start doing
            things the FDA way.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are few clear and obvious answers to the above, but these are
          discussions we have often in the YC community, and as a result, we’ve
          developed numerous opinions on these topics by working with founders.
